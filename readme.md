# Extract GPS coordinates from image
<b>EXIF</b>, which stands for Exchangeable Image File Format, acts like a digital ID card for photos. It's basically information stored with image files that tells us important details about the picture, like what camera was used, settings like aperture and shutter speed, and even when and where the photo was taken if the camera has GPS.

However, sharing photos with GPS data still attached can be risky for privacy. It might reveal personal or sensitive locations. This becomes even more concerning on social media, where anyone can easily see this information. So, it's a good idea to be careful when sharing photos with GPS data publicly.

To demonstrate how EXIF works, we've created a script that can extract and optionally save GPS and other metadata from image files with EXIF data.
